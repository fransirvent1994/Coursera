    "<b>Introduction</b><br>\n",
    "A Kubernetes cluster is a fundamental construct within Kubernetes. The cluster enables the deployment, coordination, and operation of containerised applications at scale. Instead of one incredibly huge, ridiculously fast server positioned in one place to process requests from all around the world, clusters are lots of smaller servers spread out and coordinated to serve everyone close to where they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "A cluster is a group of machines grouped to work together, but not necessarily all doing the same tasks. In a Kubernetes cluster, virtual machines (VMs) are coordinated to execute all of the functions needed to process requests, such as serving a web application, running a database, or solving big-data problems. Each cluster consists of at least one cluster control plane machine, a server that manages multiple nodes. You submit all of your work to the control plane, and the control plane distributes the work to the node or nodes where it will run. These worker nodes are virtual machine (VM) instances running the Kubernetes processes necessary to make them part of the cluster. They can be in a single zone or spread out all over the world. Depending on the use case, one node might be used for data processing and another for hosting a web server. Each of these nodes is made up of pods, which are assigned by the control plane. Each pod is made up of one or more containers that work together to execute necessary functions. \n",

    "Have you ever been to a restaurant where there is a rolling tray of desserts? Well, the tray is like a cluster, holding all the little plates. The plates are like nodes, each working to hold a different dessert. The desserts are like the pods, each performing a different flavor, or function. \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you get started working with Kubernetes clusters on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the first thing to do is create a cluster to work with. Here are the steps to creating a standard cluster: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Log in to Google Cloud Console: Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ and log in with your Google Cloud account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Open Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). In the left-hand navigation menu, select Kubernetes Engine, and then Clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Click Create Cluster to create a new Kubernetes cluster. By default, this will take you to Autopilot cluster. For these instructions, we are setting up a standard cluster, so click Switch to Standard Cluster. For more information on the difference between Standard and Autopilot, see \n",
    "Compare GKE Autopilot and Standard\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Configure cluster basics. Enter a unique cluster name for your GKE cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Choose a Location type. Zonal is for creating a cluster within a single zone. When selecting this, you will also need to select the zone where your cluster's control plane will run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regional is for multi-zone deployment. Deployment across a larger area means higher availability to users. When selecting a regional cluster, you’ll also need to choose the region. By default, three zones will be selected within the chosen region, or you can manually select the zones if you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Configure the node pool. In the Node pool section, specify the desired node count for the initial number of nodes in the default node pool depending on the needs of your application on your Kubernetes cluster. For production clusters, the recommended minimum is usually three nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum number of nodes will depend on the type of application, the expected amount of traffic, and your budget. A maximum of five to ten nodes is a good start while you get a feel for what's needed. As you configure the node pool, there's a cost estimator on the right side of the screen that estimates how much you will pay per month. You can also look over the \n",
    "GKE pricing for Standard mode\n",
    ". If you don’t set a maximum that suits your budget, and demand for your application rises sharply, you could get an expensive wake-up call. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have configured the node pool, you can enable Autoscaling by checking the box for Enable cluster autoscaler. Once enabled, Autoscaler will automatically adjust the number of nodes based on resource utilization up to the maximum number of nodes you set for the Node pool. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, choose the machine type for your nodes. There are four machine families: \n",
    "\n",
    "General purpose machines are suitable for most workloads. These machines balance performance with price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute-optimized machines provide high performance for intensive workloads like artificial intelligence and machine learning, entertainment streaming, and game servers\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory-optimized machines offer the highest memory configurations. These machines process large data sets in memory in use cases like Big Data analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accelerator-optimized machines are for very demanding workloads like machine learning (ML) training and inference, in which a neural network makes deductions about new data based on what it has already learned. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on choosing machine families or specific types, see \n",
    "Choosing the right machine family and type\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Choose any optional configurations needed. Based on your projects’ specific requirements, you can expand the Node pool section to configure advanced settings including boot disk size, preemptible nodes, node labels, and node locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also enable networking and security features based on the data governance laws and the level of security you need to maintain for your data. In the Networking section, you can choose the VPC network and subnetwork where your cluster's nodes will be placed. You can also enable Private cluster mode to hide the cluster's master endpoint from the public internet. For pod-level firewall rules, you can define network tags and network policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  Click the Create button to start creating the GKE cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  Wait for cluster creation. GKE will begin creating your cluster based on your specified configuration. The process may take a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.  Access and use your cluster. Once the cluster is successfully created, you can click on the cluster name in the GKE dashboard to view its details and manage the cluster."
