    "<h2><b><u>Build artifacts in Docker</h2></b></u>\n",
    "Build artifacts in Docker play a crucial role in the software development and deployment lifecycle. No matter what you create with code, you need to test it. You must test your code before deployment to ensure that you catch and correct all issues, defects, and errors. This is true whether your code is built as a Docker container or built the more “classic” way. The process to execute the testing varies based on the application and the programming language it’s written in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro tip: It’s important to check that Docker built the container itself correctly if you are testing your code with a containerized application.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of software testing that you can execute with Docker containers:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Unit tests:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li>These are small, granular tests written by the developer to test individual functions in the code. In Docker, unit tests are run directly on your codebase before the Docker image is built, ensuring the code is working as expected before being packaged.\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>Integration tests:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li>These refer to testing an application or microservice in conjunction with the other services on which it relies. In a Dockerized environment, integration tests are run after the docker image is built and the container is running, testing how different components operate together inside the Docker container. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>End-to-end (E2E) tests: \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li>This type of testing simulates the behavior of a real user (e.g., by opening the browser and navigating through several pages). E2E tests are run against the fully deployed docker container, checking that the entire application stack with its various components and services functions correctly as a whole.\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li>Performance tests: \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li>This type of testing identifies bottlenecks. Performance tests are run against the fully deployed Docker container and test various stresses and loads to ensure the application performs at expectations. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker makes it easy to set up and tear down tests in a repeatable and predictable way. Testing Docker containers ensures the reliability, stability, and quality of the application running within them. By testing containers, you can discover bugs and compatibility and performance issues to ensure your application functions as intended."

    "Automated testing often requires supplying configuration files, data files, and test tools to the application you want to test, which unfortunately increases the size of your container.
