    "The key to packaging your own application as a Docker image is to have a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile acts as your source of truth or instruction manual: It specifies how Docker should build the image and contains a series of commands to build the image. Each command builds a new layer that becomes part of the final image. A common process is to start with a base image such as Debian Linux or Python 3.10, install the libraries your application requires, then copy the application and any related files into the image. Let’s take a look at a simple Dockerfile for a Python application example:"
