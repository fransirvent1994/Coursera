    "Docker is an easy way to package and run applications in containers. Some would consider it the most popular containerized technology. A container is a lightweight, portable, and isolated environment that facilitates the testing and deployment of new software. Within the container, the application is isolated from all other processes on the host machine. In the programming world, there is a saying that goes, “Well, it works on my machine,” meaning that a developer wrote some code that works perfectly on their local machine but does not work on others’ machines. Docker helps solve this common—and annoying—problem by providing a consistent runtime across different environments.\n",
