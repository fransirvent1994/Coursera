    "<h1><b><u>Using multiple containers</h1></u></b>\n",
    "Imagine you are developing a web-based platform that allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, pay for items, and ship items to different addresses. This application requires multiple components to execute properly because it relies on a number of microservices. The idea behind microservices is to take a large application and break it up into smaller, more tangible, independent parts of the application that are self-contained. This allows for each part of the application to be better maintained. Because these microservices are independent of each other, you use multiple containers to test the entirety of the application to ensure everything runs smoothly. It’s no surprise that in the programming world, programmers and developers work with multiple containers at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will learn more about the use of multiple containers, commands for working with multiple containers, how related services find each other, and how to install Docker Compose and view an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Starting multiple containers</b><br>\n",
    "To start multiple containers, you need to run multiple docker run commands. A docker run command creates a container and starts it. Let’s look at an example of how to create and start two containers that work together once they find each other by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a programmer, you’ve been asked to set up a WordPress blog. You know WordPress requires a database to store its content. You create and start two containers, wordpress and db, using the following command:\n",
    "<b>\n",
    "$ docker run -d --name db --restart always \\\n",
    "\n",
    "    -v db_data:/var/lib/mysql -p 3306 -p 33060 \\\n",
    "\n",
    "    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=somewordpress \\\n",
    "\n",
    "    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress \\\n",
    "\n",
    "    -e MYSQL_USER=wordpress \\\n",
    "\n",
    "    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=wordpress \\\n",
    "\n",
    "    mariadb:10\n",
    "</b>\n",
    "This command starts the mariadb database, determines a storage volume, and sets the initial password for the WordPress user. It declares two network ports open to other containers, but it is not shown on the host machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, start the WordPress container using the following command:\n",
    "<b>\n",
    "$ docker run -d --name wordpress --restart always \\\n",
    "\n",
    "    -v wp_data:/var/www/html -p 80:80 \\\n",
    "\n",
    "    -e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=db \\\n",
    "\n",
    "    -e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=wordpress \\\n",
    "\n",
    "    -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=wordpress \\\n",
    "\n",
    "    -e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wordpress \\\n",
    "\n",
    "    wordpress:latest\n",
    "</b>\n",
    "Note: The environment variable WORDPRESS_DB_HOST is set to db on the third line. This line of code is needed to refer to another container. Docker provides domain name system (DNS) services that allow containers to find each other by their name."

    "<h2><b><u>Networking with multiple containers</h2></b></u>\n",
    "Imagine you have several customers using the same application. For security reasons, you have isolated the application and created multiple containers, one for each customer. Docker allows you to create private networks for a container or groups of containers. These private containers are able to discover each other, but no other networks will be able to find the private containers you’ve started. Let’s look at an example: modifying the wordpress and db containers by putting them on a private network.\n",

Remember, Composerize is just a tool, and unfortunately sometimes tools come and go. It’s best to understand and practice the process of converting an existing Docker run command into a Docker Compose configuration without the help of tools."
