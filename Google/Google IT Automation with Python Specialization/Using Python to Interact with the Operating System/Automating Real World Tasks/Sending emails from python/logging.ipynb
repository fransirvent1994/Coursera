    "Many Python programmers develop programs that require them to observe values to see what is going on by using print() statements. print() is a built-in Python function used for simple, immediate output to the console which can be used for debugging or quick information display. Logging is a more sophisticated and configurable logging framework that allows developers to control the level of detail, destination, and formatting of log messages. Logging makes it suitable for production-grade applications to track and analyze program behavior. print() statements are great for development, but for production, each one of these function calls increases overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of print() statements causing negative overhead is if low-priority problems arise in a script. A third-party API endpoint isn’t responding in time, so the application tries again and isn’t able to get a response. In these cases, the system doesn't tell you that the system is broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more severe problems, such as a totally offline server dependency or repeated denials for incorrect passwords, you want to know immediately. For your logs, you want to filter out errors that may go away due to external factors (data about outages and potential breaches). \n",
    "\n",
    "When logging problems occur, they generally do not happen in isolation. Having a massive amount of noise inside log files can make it hard to trace problems. This ideology is pointed out in the “Observing Application Behavior” chapter of Michal Jaworski’s book, Expert Python Programming, 4th edition. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to set up a way to notify someone in case problems arise. Filtering problems by severity level is a fantastic place to start. Logging allows this filtering with the levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Printing vs. logging\n",
    "Printing and logging are both methods you can use to display information, but they serve slightly different purposes and have different implications, depending on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Printing\n",
    "print() is a function that prints objects (strings, but also most anything else). The syntax for using the print() function to print to a file is: \n",
    "\n",
    "print(open(“my_file.txt”,”r”).read(),file=open(“new_file.txt”,”w”))\n",
    "\n",
    "print() objects sent to the text stream file must be provided as keyword arguments if they are separated by sep. These statements might also be followed by end. sep, end, file, and flush.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stream file is generally what you interact with, but sometimes you will not use Python with console output, especially in a cloud context where code is deployed that runs on some other computer. In most cases, anything printed out inside the Python code will end up in logs. This is because logs capture all or nothing regarding print().\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging\n",
    "The logging module provides an object-oriented way to print out statements with the additional advantage of using severity levels. More advanced features include the ability to filter which messages you care about, to route to more destinations than just the console/terminal, and to see the difference between normal print() statements and print() statements used for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in logging levels \n",
    "The logging module provides five built-in log levels. In order of severity, they are debug, info, warning, error, and critical. These are referred to as methods of the logging object. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output of a logging statement will resemble:\n",
    "\n",
    "[LOG_LEVEL]:root:[MESSAGE]\n",
    "\n",
    "The name “root” in this context means logging was called directly instead of setting up a logger by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example of import logging:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set up basic configuration to display all log levels\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Log messages for each severity level\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.debug(\"This is a DEBUG message.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.info(\"This is an INFO message.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.warning(\"This is a WARNING message.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.error(\"This is an ERROR message.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.critical(\"This is a CRITICAL message.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This prints out:\n",
    "\n",
    "DEBUG:root:This is a DEBUG message.\n",
    "\n",
    "INFO:root:This is an INFO message.\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING:root:This is a WARNING message.\n",
    "\n",
    "ERROR:root:This is an ERROR message.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRITICAL:root:This is a CRITICAL message.\n",
    "\n",
    "This print out includes all of the pre-defined logging points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handlers\n",
    "Handlers are advanced ways to manage and route logs. Handlers define the output destinations for log messages, allowing you to control where the log data goes, such as writing to files, sending emails, or printing to the console. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic handler is StreamHandler. The StreamHandler class allows you to configure logging to display log messages on the screen, making it useful for providing feedback, debugging, and monitoring during the execution of a program. This is the print() equivalent for logging, but StreamHandler also allows routing from arbitrary objects. Handlers can be attached to user-defined loggers using addHandler() or can be directly invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a custom logger with a debug and a StreamHandler attached to it with a different severity level:\n",
    "\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setting up the logger and StreamHandler\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a logger\n",
    "\n",
    "stream_logger = logging.getLogger('stream_logger')\n",
    "\n",
    "stream_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # Set logger to capture all messages from DEBUG level and above\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ensure no previous handlers are attached\n",
    "\n",
    "stream_logger.handlers = []\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a StreamHandler\n",
    "\n",
    "stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n",
    "\n",
    "stream_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)  # Set handler to display only messages from INFO level and above\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding handler to logger\n",
    "\n",
    "stream_logger.addHandler(stream_handler)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logging messages at different levels\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "stream_logger.warning(\"This is a WARNING message for stream_logger.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "stream_logger.error(\"This is an ERROR message for stream_logger.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "stream_logger.critical(\"This is a CRITICAL message for stream_logger.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "output:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an INFO message for stream_logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a WARNING message for stream_logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an ERROR message for stream_logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a CRITICAL message for stream_logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different types of logging handlers\n",
    "Besides StreamHandler, there are also many other handlers: \n",
    "\n",
    "FileHandler\n",
    "\n",
    "NullHandler\n",

    "Logging business data to a database\n",
    "An advanced use case, but one very common in most cloud operations, is logging business-relevant data, such as logins and expensive requests, to a database. This logging would also generate alerts for outages and other items that require immediate attention. To do this with Python logging, one may combine the capabilities of the logging library with a database library. This enables the creation of custom handlers or loggers that interact with the database, allowing seamless storage and retrieval of crucial operational data to enable effective monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways\n",
    "These takeaways emphasize the significance of logging for effective software development and production monitoring, as well as the distinction between using print() statements and the more structured approach of logging with severity levels and handlers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead of print()statements in production: Although using print() statements is convenient for development, it can lead to increased overhead in production environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguishing severity levels for effective monitoring: Differentiating between various issues' severity levels is crucial. By using severity levels in logging, you can effectively filter out transient errors and monitor significant problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using logging handlers for advanced log management: Logging handlers are essential components for directing log messages to various destinations. They provide advanced capabilities, such as filtering messages, routing to multiple destinations, and enabling custom loggers.  "

    "<h1><b><u>The logging module</h1></u></b><br>\n",
    "The logging module in Python is a readily available, robust module that can be used by both novice programmers and professional teams. Because the majority of Python third-party libraries use it, you can combine your log messages with messages from both libraries to create a uniform log for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many applications, especially backend components that don’t directly interact with users, keep a log of their activities to aid in troubleshooting problems or monitoring the application’s performance. The Python logging module provides a standardized way of outputting those log messages to the system console, a file, the system logging daemon (syslogd), or other destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers will often insert code that logs any or all of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions the program is about to take, is taking, or just completed\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of parameters and variables that might affect the program’s behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Return values or output from other components (such as web services or databases)\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing and other performance data\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize both the formatting of your log and the level of detail that gets logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Five levels of the logging module\n",
    "A developer decides on a “severity” for each log message. The logger is configured to log anything above a certain severity level; everything else gets ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The severity levels are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "DEBUG: Extra information only needed for debugging. This level often includes values of parameters and variables to help with troubleshooting. Example: logging Parameter x: 42 to aid in diagnosing issues and include parameter values\n",
    "\n",
    "INFO: Informational message that can be used for tracing the program’s activities. Example: connecting to MySQL database at mydbserver.aws.amazon.com\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: An error that doesn’t require immediate action. Examples: query took longer than 10 seconds, configuration file not found, or reverting to default settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "ERROR: Serious, but can be a recoverable error. Example: database connection failed, or a file is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRITICAL: Fatal error. Example: A critical error has occurred! The application will now terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You decide how much detail to put into your log file. Many programs have a “DEBUG” flag that you can turn on to output additional debugging information. When things go wrong, more detail is always better than less, especially at the DEBUG level. Most of the time you can leave your logging at INFO to keep the log readable, but don’t be afraid to throw additional logging into your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you initialize the logger with INFO as the minimum level, then the log will contain everything from INFO to CRITICAL. DEBUG messages will be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can configure your logger to include multiple handlers; each one logs to a different destination. This way, you can log to the console and to a file at the same time, with a different level of detail (minimum severity level) for each destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initializing a logger\n",
    "Initializing the logger typically refers to the process of setting up and configuring a logging system using the built-in logging module. Initializing the logger involves creating a logger object, specifying its configuration, and defining how log messages should be handled and formatted. The steps involve the following: Import the logging module, create a logger instance, configure the logger, and then start logging messages.  \n",

    "Another is colorlog, which adds helpful color highlights when logging to the console. An example of this is assigning different colors to log levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. This step can make it quicker to spot the severity of each log message at a glance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that these alternatives are nearly drop-in replacements for the built-in logging module, so you don’t need much in the way of code changes to use them.
