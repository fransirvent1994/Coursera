    "A distributed system is a collection of software components that are designed to work together even though they’re on separate servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed systems, also referred to as distributed computing or distributed databases, utilize different nodes to interact and synchronize over a shared network. These nodes can also represent independent software processes or other recursive encapsulated systems. They often represent independent physical hardware items as well, such as servers. Distributed systems work to eliminate system bottlenecks and single points of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common example of a distributed system would be a website that contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "Presentation logic – responsible for displaying the user interface and handling user interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Business logic – manages the application's rules and processes, ensuring proper data handling and functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Database engine – stores and retrieves data used by the website\n",
    "\n",
    "Web server – serves as the intermediary between the user's browser and the various components\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these items could be run on a single server, but it is common to run each component on separate servers for redundancy and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a distributed system:\n",
    "Distributed computing systems have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource sharing – A distributed system may share hardware, software, or data\n",
    "\n",
    "Error detection – Errors and inefficiencies can be more easily detected\n",
    "\n",
    "Transparency – A node in the system can interact and communicate with other nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Simultaneous processing – The same function can be processed by multiple machines at once\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability – If more machines are added, the computation and processing power can increase as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneity - The majority of distributed systems have asynchronous nodes and components that use various operating systems, middleware, software, and hardware which make it possible to expand or add new components\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed systems are used in various applications and scenarios, including cloud computing, web services, peer-to-peer networks, content delivery networks (CDNs), grid computing, and more. They enable organizations to harness the power of multiple machines and locations to achieve high performance, fault tolerance, and scalability in their computing environments. However, designing and managing distributed systems can be complex, requiring careful consideration of communication protocols, data consistency, and fault-tolerant strategies. Let’s take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of using a distributed system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of a distributed system\n",
    "Distributed computing systems have the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility - You can tune the characteristics of each server to the component that it will be hosting. For example, an application server might need more memory or CPU; a database server needs more disk and I/O throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large volume - You can run multiple copies of components for fault tolerance or to handle higher amounts of traffic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Redundancy of nodes - A distributed system's nodes provide redundancy so that if one fails, there are other nodes available to step in and take its place. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fault tolerance - By lowering the risks associated with having a single point of failure, distributed systems improve dependability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of a distributed system\n",
    "Distributed computing systems have the following disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased complexity - Compared to conventional computer environments, distributed systems are more difficult to design, administer, and comprehend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra work - Components have to do some extra work to find each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Potential introduction of new problems - Network problems could introduce a new point of failure into your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential introduction of delays - The network could also introduce some delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased costs - In contrast to centralized systems, distributed systems' scalability enables managers to quickly add more capacity as needed, which can potentially raise expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "On one hand, if you are designing an application that needs to scale, you should build in some awareness of distributed systems architecture from the beginning. You should not assume that everything is on the same server as you. Try to find some way for each component to discover the others (anything from a configuration file, to a service catalog, to a full service mesh). On the other hand, don’t overcomplicate things before you need to. Overcomplicated designs can be fragile and hard to maintain in the long term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways\n",
    "Distributed systems are crucial in various applications, but require careful design and management to address their complexities and potential challenges.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Definition of distributed systems - A distributed system is a collection of software components that collaborate across separate servers or nodes, often using a shared network. These systems aim to eliminate bottlenecks and single points of failure by distributing tasks and functions across multiple components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics of distributed systems - Distributed computing systems exhibit several key characteristics, including resource sharing, error detection, transparency, simultaneous processing, scalability, and heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages and disadvantages - Distributed systems offer advantages such as flexibility, handling large volumes of traffic, redundancy of nodes, and fault tolerance. However, they also come with disadvantages like increased complexity, the need for extra work to locate components, potential introduction of new problems and delays due to network issues, and increased costs associated with scalability."
